          Our journey began with a profound mission to illuminate the path of early intervention powered by AI. 
          Motivated by the struggles and victories of Ram, our founder’s son, our quest was driven by love, passion, 
          and determination. Witnessing Ram’s remarkable progress inspired us to empower parents worldwide with 
          the confidence to embrace early intervention and forge a better future for their children.
